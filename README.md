# odin-recipes

This is a basic HTML recipes website, using what I've learned so far from the Odin Project course.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
It will not look pretty nor is it meant to be, but it will be styled in the CSS section of the course.

At the end of this exercise I would like to be able to construct a basic HTML website, understand the different components of the site and to debug any challenges along the way.
