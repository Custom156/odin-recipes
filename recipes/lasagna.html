      <em>Everyone</em> loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect
      dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy
      for days.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Make Lasagna</h2>
    <p>
      For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce and layering that with
      noodles and cheese into a casserole. Here's the run-down:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Start by making the sauce</strong> with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a
        combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives
        the sauce great depth of flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready.</strong>
        We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan—like the mix of tomatoes, this
        3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>From there, it's just an assembly job.</strong> A cup of meat sauce, a layer of
        noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and
        have used up all the ingredients.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How to Freeze and Reheat Lasagna</h2>
    You can also freeze the lasagna either baked or unbaked.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>To freeze an unbaked lasagna:</strong> Line the pan with foil before assembling,
        then assemble the lasagna as directly. Let cool completely, and then freeze until solid.
        Once frozen, lift the frozen lasagna block from the casserole dish, wrap it in more foil,
        then freeze for up to a month.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>To reheat an unbaked frozen lasagna:</strong> Remove the lasagna from the freezer
        and unwrap all the layers of foil. Transfer to the original casserole dish, cover, and let
        it thaw in the fridge overnight. Once thawed, bake as directed.

        all the layers of foil. Transfer to the original casserole dish, cover, and let it thaw in
        the fridge overnight. Once thawed, warm the whole casserole (covered with foil) in the oven
        at 350°F until bubbly again.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>To freeze and reheat individual slices:</strong> Cut the baked and cooled casserole
        into slices and wrap each slice individually in foil. Combine them in a freezer storage bag
        and freeze for up to 1 month. Thaw overnight in the fridge. To reheat, unwrap from the foil,
        place on a microwave-safe dish, and warm in the microwave for a few minutes until bubbly.
